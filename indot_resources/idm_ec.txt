INDOT Design Manual Erosion and Sediment Control guidance.
Stabilization timing: disturbed soils inactive for more than 14 days shall be stabilized.
Sediment basins may be required when drainage area exceeds threshold (verify with INDOT).
Winter stabilization requires mulch cover.
Mulch or hydraulic mulch should be used on slopes exceeding 3% to limit erosion.
